When you finish a long rest, reduce your Exhausted penalty by 1.</p><p>Unlike most conditions, Exhausted has a cumulative effect. When you gain a second instance of this condition, add its listed penalty to your current Exhausted penalty.</p><p>For example, if an effect makes you Exhausted (−2), you subtract 2 from all tests; if a different effect then makes you Exhausted (−1), that increases your Exhausted penalty, so you now subtract 3 from all tests.</p>",
